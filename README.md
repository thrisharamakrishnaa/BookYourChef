# BookYourChef

BookYourChef is a beginner-level web application that allows users to book professional chefs who come to their homes, cook fresh meals, and leave. The concept is inspired by service-based platforms focusing on convenience, personalization, and home-style cooking.

## 📌 Problem Statement
With busy urban lifestyles, many people rely on food delivery apps that often lack personalization, freshness, and health-focused options. There is a growing need for a solution that provides freshly cooked meals at home without the user having to cook themselves.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
BookYourChef provides a simple web platform where users can:
- View available chefs
- Choose chefs based on preference
- Book a chef for a specific date and time
- Enjoy freshly cooked meals at home

This project demonstrates how an on-demand service model can be applied to home cooking.

## 🚀 Features
- Home page with project overview
- List of available chefs
- Chef profile display
- Simple booking form
- Beginner-friendly and clean UI
